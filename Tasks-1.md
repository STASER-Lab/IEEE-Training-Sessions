## T1-02:
### Description: 
After running python3 T1-02.py, the  program takes a string as an input and  counts the number of occurrences of each word. The program should store  the words counts in a dictionary and print the results. 

* Example Output 
``` 
$ python3 T1-02.py 
Enter a string: Hello world! 
hello again, World.         
'hello': 2, 
'world': 2,

``` 

## T1-1:
### Description: 
After running python3 T1-1.py, the program first  randomly generates 100 lower-cased characters (a-z)  and randomly generates 100 integers (1-20 inclusive).  Pair the randomly generated characters and numbers together to form a dictionary, where the key is  characters and the value is the list of integers paired  with the character. Print out the dictionary content one key per line sorted by key (a-z), and also the list of numbers sorted in increasing order.

* Example Output 
``` 
$ python3 T1-1.py 
a 3 5 6 
b 1 1 2 4 5 
c 19 
... 
z 1 12 20
```
